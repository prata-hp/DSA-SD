1. EXTRACTION OF DIGITS FROM A GIVEN NUMBER= N%10 TILL THE NUMBER OF DIGITS 

2. Reversing a number = 
last digit = n%10;
n = n/10;
revnum = (revnum*10) + lastdigit;

3.Palindrome= reverse is exactly same as original
  
4.Armstrong Number = calc digit+   loop()...look notes

5.  Print of all divisors

6.
